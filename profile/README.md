## IGTF: Interoperable Global Trust Federation

The international Research and e-Infrastructure community is deploying large scale distributed computing on a production scale, across organisations, across countries, and across
continents, for the advancement of science and engineering. In shaping this common infrastructure, they are relying on common practices, policies and procedures to reliably identify users, subscribers and resources.

The IGTF is a body to establish common policies and guidelines that help establish interoperable, global trust relations between providers of e-Infrastructures and cyber-infrastructures, 
identity providers, and other qualified relying parties. The IGTF consists of three regional Policy Management Authorities (PMAs) in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and in
Europe, the Middle-East and Africa. The IGTF is governed by a common charter.  See https://igtf.net/ for more details. 

This Github organisation hosts source repositories and utilities in support of the global trust fabric.
